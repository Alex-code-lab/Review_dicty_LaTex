    abstract = "{Under normal conditions, the Arp2/3 complex activator SCAR/WAVE controls actin polymerization in pseudopods, whereas Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) assembles actin at clathrin-coated pits. We show that, unexpectedly, Dictyostelium discoideum SCAR knockouts could still spread, migrate, and chemotax using pseudopods driven by the Arp2/3 complex. In the absence of SCAR, some WASP relocated from the coated pits to the leading edge, where it behaved with similar dynamics to normal SCAR, forming split pseudopods and traveling waves. Pseudopods colocalized with active Rac, whether driven by WASP or SCAR, though Rac was activated to a higher level in SCAR mutants. Members of the SCAR regulatory complex, in particular PIR121, were not required for WASP regulation. We thus show that WASP is able to respond to all core upstream signals and that regulators coupled through the other members of SCAR’s regulatory complex are not essential for pseudopod formation. We conclude that WASP and SCAR can regulate pseudopod actin using similar mechanisms.}",

    abstract = "{It is generally believed that cytoskeletal activities drive random cell migration, whereas signal transduction events initiated by receptors regulate the cytoskeleton to guide cells. However, we find that the cytoskeletal network, involving SCAR/WAVE, Arp 2/3 and actin-binding proteins, is capable of generating only rapid oscillations and undulations of the cell boundary. The signal transduction network, comprising multiple pathways that include Ras GTPases, PI(3)K and Rac GTPases, is required to generate the sustained protrusions of migrating cells. The signal transduction network is excitable, exhibiting wave propagation, refractoriness and maximal response to suprathreshold stimuli, even in the absence of the cytoskeleton. We suggest that cell motility results from coupling of ‘pacemaker’ signal transduction and ‘idling motor’ cytoskeletal networks, and various guidance cues that modulate the threshold for triggering signal transduction events are integrated to control the mode and direction of migration.}",
